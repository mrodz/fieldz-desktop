## Welcome to the new wave of field administration
Fieldz is an app designed for youth sports region administrators by a former youth soccer player. Its primary purpose is to schedule matches given a set of input parameters. 

## This app is new!
For now, the distributions under the `Releases` tab are UI concepts, as the glue to call the working scheduling algorithm has yet to be written. 
If you are a region administrator, please leave your feedback as to how the user experience affects your ease of use, and whether the app is missing any critical features or scheduling parameters.

## Wiki
Learn about installation as well as some of the app's features and navigation under its [wiki](https://github.com/mrodz/fieldz-desktop/wiki). There, you will find helpful guides accompanied by screenshots and descriptions of what each window is used for.

Thanks for checking out the app!
